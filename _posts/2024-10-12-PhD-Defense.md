I defended my PhD dissertation titled “Intrinsic approaches to learning and computing on curved surfaces” and received the doctor’s title cum laude 🎉 It was a beautiful day with many happy moments. Thanks to all who made this possible: my collaborators and friends, colleagues and mentors! [You can watch a recording of the defense including the Layman's talk](https://collegerama.tudelft.nl/mediasite/Showcase/phd-defence/Presentation/3b3ebd766f3040ee9b2db099847d446a1d) (15 min summary for non-experts).
