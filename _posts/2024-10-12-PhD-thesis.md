abstract: "This dissertation develops intrinsic approaches to learning and computing on curved surfaces. Specifically, we work on three tasks: analyzing 3D shapes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), solving linear systems on curved surfaces, and recovering appearance properties from curved surfaces using multi-view capture. We argue that we can find more efficient and better performing algorithms for these tasks by using intrinsic geometry."
