I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Interactive Geometry Lab at ETH Zürich since September 2024. In my research I seek to connect computer graphics- and geometry processing techniques to applications in machine learning. I received my doctorate _cum laude_ from the [Computer Graphics and Visualization group at the University of Technology Delft](http://graphics.tudelft.nl) in October 2024. I was advised by [Dr. Klaus Hildebrandt](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/~klaus) and supervised by [Prof. Dr. Elmar Eisemann](http://graphics.tudelft.nl/~eisemann) and Prof. Dr. Joris Dik.

I have gathered experience as a graphic designer and filmmaker during my undergraduate years. You can find some examples of [that work on this website](/category/creative-portfolio.html). Outside of academia, I enjoy [making music](https://soundcloud.com/rubenwiersma), reading and discussing books, watching movies, biking, and playing soccer.
